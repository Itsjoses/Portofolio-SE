When new assistants or staff are onboarded, the Network System team must create AD accounts for each user to access the features and internal web of the SLC. It is important to note that newly created AD accounts will have random passwords, making the testing process quite challenging as each account must be tested individually. To address this issue, this script is needed to expedite the testing process.
